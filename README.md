# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Fengjie Li, currently a postgraduate student at the [Software Analysis and Intelligent Lab (SAIL) in the College of Intelligence and Computing at Tianjin University](https://tjusail.github.io/), working towards alleviating the pain of bug fixing. In particular, I am researching to explore how computer can automatically fixes bugs by employing techniques such as program analysis, AST analysis and AI models. Earlier, I graduated with Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from Tianjin University.

# 💡 My Interest

I’m interested in Automatic Program Repair (APR). My research passion is Programming Language Analysis -- A way hecking into source code. More specifically, I am motivated by building tools and techniques that reduce the burden on programmers by automating the bug-fixing process they encounter in their daily work. Over the years, I have been building developer assistance tools with research collaboration across Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Program Analysis.

# ⛰️ My Goal

😎 **Learning:**

* Program Analysis, AST Traveling & Matching, AI Models Finetuning and Defect Prediction.

💪 **Struggling:**

* Successfully obtained a master's degree.
* Improving problem-solving abilities in programming.

# 🎮 **Gaming:**

* Elden Ring💍, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Overwatch...

Looking forward to game friends🤗 PlayStation ID: FFengJay; Nintendo Switch: SW-1513-8374-2230.
