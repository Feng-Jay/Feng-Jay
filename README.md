# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Fengjie Li, currently a postgraduate student at the [Software Analysis and Intelligent Lab (SAIL) in the College of Intelligence and Computing at Tianjin University](https://tjusail.github.io/), working towards alleviating the pain of bug fixing. Earlier, I graduated with Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from Tianjin University. I enjoy reading, running, and playing video games in my spare time.

# 💡 My Interest

I am interested in Automated Program Repair (APR), with a broader research passion for Program Analysis—a discipline that enables deep insights into source code. Specifically, I am motivated by developing tools and techniques that reduce the burden on programmers by automating the bug-fixing process they face in daily development. Over the years, I have been building developer-assistance tools through collaborative research at the intersection of Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Program Analysis.

# ⛰️ My Goal

😎 **Learning:**

* Program Analysis, AST Travelsal & Matching, LLMs.

💪 **Struggling:**

* Successfully obtained a master's degree.
* Improving problem-solving abilities in programming.

# 🎮 **Gaming:**

* Elden Ring💍, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Overwatch2...

Looking forward to game friends🤗 PlayStation ID: FFengJay; Nintendo Switch: SW-1513-8374-2230.
